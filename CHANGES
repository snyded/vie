o Now copes with modern vi's
o No longer destroys your source files if the Informix compiler loses it's
  mind so badly that it truncates the .err files
o Now lets you run vie on a .err file many times before recompilation
  (was deleting the .err file at the end of vie, which was annoying and
  somewhat redundant given that a successful compile will remove it anyway)

determine if the error file might be a form error file.
